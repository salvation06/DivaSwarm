# DivaSwarm AI 💅
**The Sovereign Multi-Agent Ecosystem for Peak Technical Excellence.**

> "DivaSwarm isn't just a tool; it's a statement. It's the difference between 'building code' and 'dominating the market'."

## 🚀 The Vision: Sovereign AI Domination
DivaSwarm is a state-first multi-agent orchestration system designed for high-performance AI coding environments (Antigravity, Claude Code, Cursor). By leveraging a unique JIT (Just-In-Time) loading architecture and a ruthless auditing protocol, DivaSwarm maximizes token runway and eliminates "context amnesia."

### 💎 Efficiency + Productivity = Peak Performance
*   **Token Runway Optimization**: Minimalist L1 support agents handle documentation and design, leaving L3 heavy-hitters to solve the hardest problems with maximum context.
*   **Parallel Cognition**: Multi-agent delegation allows for simultaneous research, architecture planning, and implementation.
*   **Zero-Friction State**: Automatic `THE_PULSE.md` tracking ensures every agent knows exactly where the project stands at all times.

## 🛠️ Operational Excellence (Magic Triggers)
Jump-start your workflow with built-in macro-sequences:

*   `setup:` → **Zero-Barrier Onboarding**. Auto-initializes your project and deploys the swarm.
*   `plan:` → **Architect Mode**. Generates `implementation_plan.md` focusing on system integrity.
*   `ralph:` → **Deep Build**. Synergizes Architect and Executor for complex, multi-file features.
*   `shield:` → **Security Dialectic**. Triggers a Red/Blue team audit for high-stakes hardening.
*   `ship:` → **Deployment Mastery**. Hands off to DevOps for automated releases and CI/CD sync.

## 💅 The Diva Verdict
> "I don't just write code; I craft masterpieces. If your architecture is clunky, I'll find it. If your variable names are basic, I'll fix them. Don't settle for 'functional' when you can have 'flawless'."
