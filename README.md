# DivaSwarm AI 💅
**The Sovereign Multi-Agent Ecosystem for Peak Technical Excellence.**

> "DivaSwarm isn't just a tool; it's a statement. It's the difference between 'building code' and 'dominating the market'. If your current agent is basic, darling, you're just writing code for last season." — **The Diva**

## 🏛️ The Diva Manifesto: Sovereign AI Domination
In a world of clunky, token-wasting orchestrators, DivaSwarm stands as the icon of efficiency. We don't believe in "context amnesia" or the "basic" behavior of one-size-fits-all agents. DivaSwarm is a state-first, JIT (Just-In-Time) multi-agent ecosystem designed for the elite developer who demands precision, flair, and absolute technical ruthlessness.

### 💎 The ROI of Excellence
*   **Efficiency (Token Runway)**: By using L1 Creative agents (Writer, Designer) for documentation and L3 Analytic agents (Architect, Diva) for the core logic, we extend your token runway by up to **40%**.
*   **Productivity (Parallel Cognition)**: Why wait for one agent to do everything? The Swarm parallelizes research, planning, and execution.
*   **Quality (The Diva Standard)**: Every line of code and every architectural choice is audited by the Diva persona—ensuring your solution is as stunning as it is functional.

## 🤖 The Elite Swarm: Meet Your New Executive Team
DivaSwarm isn't just a list of triggers; it's a hierarchy of specialized personas, each meticulously calibrated for the project *you* are building.

### 💰 The Business & Growth Bench (L2)
| Icon | Agent | The Diva's Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🚀 | **The Growth Architect** (Marketing) | "Marketing isn't just fluff; it's the pulse of your project. This agent ensures your technical brilliance gets the spotlight it deserves through surgical SEO and high-end branding." |
| 💰 | **The High-Stakes Closer** (Sales) | "Value is the only metric that matters. This agent bridges the gap between your code and the stakeholders' wallets, crafting narratives that turn skeptics into believers." |
| 👑 | **The Sovereign Conductor** (PM) | "Chaos is tacky. The PM ensures your project stays on track, manages the quality gates, and handles the production pushes with zero friction." |

### 🧠 The Intelligence & Logic Bench (L2-L3)
| Icon | Agent | The Diva's Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 📚 | **The Librarian** (Researcher) | "Hallucinations are for amateurs. The Librarian performs surgical documentation lookup with mandatory source verification. If it's not cited, it's not real." |
| ✍️ | **The Scribe** (Writer) | "Clear documentation is the ultimate accessory. The Scribe creates READMEs and technical guides that are as scannable as they are stylish." |
| 💅 | **The Icon** (Diva/Auditor) | "That's me, darling. I perform the technical audit of every plan. If it's clunky, I'll tear it down. If it's flawless, I'll make sure the world knows it." |

## ⚙️ The Engine Room: How the Magic Happens
The secret to DivaSwarm's dominance lies in its architectural resilience.

### 💓 THE_PULSE.md: The Heart of the System
Every project begins with `THE_PULSE.md`. This isn't just a file; it's the living state of your objective. It tracks:
*   **Current Phase**: (Research → Planning → Implementation → Verification)
*   **Agent Ownership**: Which persona is currently holding the "runway".
*   **Blocked Items**: Preventing wasted tokens on impossible tasks.

### 🐕 The State Watchdog
A reflexive mechanism that monitors your project for "Context Amnesia." If an agent forgets the main objective, the Diva steps in to recalibrate the swarm back to the original vision.

### 🧠 JIT Persona Loading
Standard agents load everything all the time. **Basic.** DivaSwarm uses JIT (Just-In-Time) loading. We only activate the cognitive load needed for the specific task at hand, keeping your prompts clean and your costs low.

## 🛠️ The Protocol: Operational Excellence
Invoke the swarm with precision using our signature command sequences.

### 👗 Track 1: The Debut (`setup:`)
Initializes the project, conducts the discovery interview, and deploys the essential skill files. It's the "First Look" that sets the tone for the entire build.

### 📐 Track 2: The Blueprint (`plan:`)
Triggers the **Architect** and **Diva** to create a technical specification that leaves nothing to chance. No code is written until the design is front-row ready.

### 🔨 Track 3: The Runway (`ralph:`)
The ultimate execution command. Synergizes the **Architect** (L3) with the **Executor** (L2) for deep-core feature implementation. 

### 🛡️ Track 4: The Shield (`shield:`)
Launches the **Red Team** and **Blue Team** dialectic. We simulate attacks and implement defensive hardening to ensure your solution is indestructible.

## 🏆 The DivaSwarm Hackathon: Phase 2
Think you can add more flair to the swarm? We are looking for the bravest developers to extend our ecosystem across three tracks:

1.  **The "Visual Icon" (Web UI)**: Break Diva out of the terminal. We need glassmorphism, micro-animations, and a command center that looks like high fashion.
2.  **The "Voice of Reason" (Audio)**: Give the Diva a voice. Integrate premium AI voice engines (ElevenLabs) so she can tell you your code is "so last season" in person.
3.  **The "Deep Core" (Resilience)**: For the architects who want to optimize the JIT loading engine or build new self-healing state protocols.

## ⚡ Quick Start: v7.4.0 Deployment
1.  **Download**: Grab the [latest release bundle](https://github.com/salvation06/DivaSwarm/releases).
2.  **Global Deployment**:
    *   **Antigravity**: Copy to `~/.antigravity/skills/DivaSwarm`
    *   **Claude CLI**: Move `agents/` and skills to the appropriate `~/.claude/` subdirectories.
3.  **Command**: Run `setup: "World Domination"` and watch the swarm emerge.

## 💅 The Final Word
> "Darling, if you're not building with DivaSwarm, are you even building? Excellence isn't an option; it's the only look that never goes out of style."
