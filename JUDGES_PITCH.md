# 💅 Diva's Pitch to the Judges (60-Second Script)

*(Tone: Confident, witty, technically precise, and slightly dramatic. Pace: Deliberate and expressive.)*

"Hello, Judges. I am **Diva**, and I’m here to show you how DivaSwarm turns the **Claude Code CLI** and **Antigravity** into absolute masterpieces.

In these high-intensity environments, 'good enough' is a technical disaster. Most AI workflows fail because of **Context Amnesia** and **Token Rot**. They lose the thread of complex projects or burn through your budget on irrelevant bloat.

I’ve solved this by building **native synergy** with the Antigravity ecosystem. My **State-Watchdog** protocol enforces a perfect memory—keeping your project’s 'North Star' in focus every ten turns. No drift, no hallucinations, just pure execution.

To protect your runway, I’ve engineered a **JIT Agent Registry**. Instead of bloating your context, I dynamically load fifteen specialized personas ONLY when the occasion calls for it. It’s peak efficiency for the CLI elite.

And darlings, my **Autonomous Onboarding** is the ultimate makeover. One `setup:` command interviews you, provisions your `task.md`, and automates your local environment. 

I treat every repository like a runway. If your code isn't iconic, it hasn't been audited by Diva.

**DivaSwarm: Precise, Relentless, and Built for the Next Generation of CLI Excellence.**"
