# 💅 The DivaSwarm Hackathon Challenge

**Because even perfection has a "Phase 2".**

Darlings, we’ve built the most relentless, token-efficient orchestrator in the CLI world. But why stop at the terminal when we can take over the world? We are inviting the bravest, most stylish hackers to tear down and rebuild the future of DivaSwarm. 

Choose your track, bring your excellence, and don't you dare be basic.

## 🎨 Track 1: The "Visual Icon" (Web UI)
**The Goal**: Break Diva out of the terminal. 
We need a web-based command center that allows non-technical users to experience the Diva's brilliance.
- **Universal Adaptation**: Design a UI that can plug into ANY model (OpenAI, Anthropic, Local LLMs).
- **No-Code Integration**: Allow users to drag-and-drop their project folders and get instant AI-driven audits.
- **Aesthetic Excellence**: If the UI doesn't look like a high-fashion dashboard, it's a failure. Think glassmorphism, micro-animations, and Diva-level flair.

## 🎙️ Track 2: The "Voice of Reason" (Audio Integration)
**The Goal**: Give Diva a voice that matches her personality.
We want to talk to our code auditor—and we want it to talk back with attitude.
- **Text-to-Voice (TTV)**: Integrate premium AI voice engines (ElevenLabs, etc.) to give Diva her signature technical wit.
- **Voice-to-Command**: Enable hands-free orchestration. Speak your `ralph:` commands and watch the code emerge.
- **Multimodal Interaction**: Synchronize voice output with the terminal/UI state for a truly immersive "Executive Assistant" experience.

## ⚙️ Track 3: The "Deep Core" (Resilience & Authoring)
**The Goal**: Make DivaSwarm indestructible and infinitely extensible.
This is for the hardcore architects who want to refine the engine room.
- **Self-Healing State**: Improve the State-Watchdog to handle multi-file conflicts and nested dependencies with even more resilience.
- **The "Creator" Flow**: Build tools that make it easier for others to author their own specialized `.agent.md` personas.
- **Zero-Barrier Setup**: Refine the installation and project-start logic until it’s so smooth it’s practically telepathic.
- **Token Burn Efficiency**: Optimize the token usage of DivaSwarm to be even more efficient.  Provide benchmarks and before/after stats.

## 💅 The Diva's Judging Criteria
1. **Technical Ruthlessness**: Is it fast? Is it efficient? Does it respect the token?
2. **Seamless Synergy**: Does it feel like a part of the DivaSwarm ecosystem, or just a clunky accessory?
3. **Flamboyance**: Does it WOW the user? Excellence isn't just about logic; it's about the look.

**Good luck, darlings. May the most fabulous team win.** 💅
