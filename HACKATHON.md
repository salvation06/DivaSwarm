# DivaSwarm: High-Performance Orchestration for Claude Code & Antigravity 💅

**Because "functional" is just a polite way of saying your Claude CLI is wearing last year's tech.**

## 💅 Inspiration
Darlings, let's be real: most AI agents suffer from appalling "Context Amnesia" and "Token Bloat"—the software equivalent of wearing socks with sandals. When working in high-intensity environments like **Claude Code CLI** and **Antigravity**, every token matters and context is king. We watched agents lose their way in complex codebases or burn through budgets like they were at a clearance sale. We were inspired to create a system that elevates these platforms from "tools" to "masterpieces"—an orchestrator that treats your repo like a runway and demands technical excellence at every turn.

## ✨ What it does
DivaSwarm v6.1.0 isn't just a script; it’s a high-performance lifestyle for your **Claude Code** and **Antigravity** workflows.
- **Platform-Native Onboarding**: The `setup:` trigger provides zero-config initialization tailored specifically for CLI and Antigravity users. It interviews the user, auto-provisions a `task.md`, and deploys local skills—taking you from "blank folder" to "runway ready" in seconds.
- **State-Watchdog**: We solve the "Context Drift" problem inherent in long CLI sessions. Diva enforces a "heartbeat" every 10 turns, keeping your project’s "North Star" in focus and your context pristine.
- **The Auditor’s Critique**: Every major implementation is judged by **The Diva**. She ensures your code isn't just working, but is DRY, SOLID, and stunning—specifically optimized for the technical ruthlessness these platforms demand.

## 🏗️ How we built it (Integrated Intelligence)
We built DivaSwarm using a **JIT (Just-In-Time) Agent Registry** specifically designed to maximize the **Antigravity** toolset.
- **Engineered a JIT Core**: Lightweight `SKILL.md` orchestrator that dynamically "loads" specialized markdown contexts ONLY when the occasion calls for it. This saves thousands of tokens per session—crucial for high-volume CLI users.
- **PowerShell Automation Engine**: A robust `setup.ps1` that takes the guesswork out of project bootstrapping, ensuring a standard, reliable structure across all your Antigravity solutions.
- **Dialectical Stress-Testing**: A Skeptic/Believer system that forces architectural choices to survive a technical roast before they ever touch your main branch.

## 👠 Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge? Balancing agency with platform reliability. Purely natural-language instructions for project setup are... well, they’re unreliable, darling. We overcame this by building a dedicated PowerShell bridge, ensuring that the AI’s "vision" in the CLI is backed up by rock-solid local automation. We also optimized our hand-off protocol to ensure specialized agents didn't trip over each other during complex cross-file audits.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **Peak Token Runway**: Our JIT loading reduced per-turn token usage by over 60%. In the world of Claude Code CLI, that’s not just a saving; it’s a superpower.
- **Seamless Antigravity Synergy**: This is the first orchestrator that feels like a native extension of the Antigravity ecosystem, not just a layer on top.
- **The "Diva Effect"**: We’ve turned code quality into something users actually care about. When the Auditor likes your code, it’s not just working—it’s *iconic*.

## 📖 What we learned
We learned that **Constraints spawn Creativity**. By strictly limiting turn counts and forcing periodic state updates, the AI became more precise and less prone to "looping meltdowns." We also discovered that "Software as a Persona" is far more effective for auditing than generic, boring instructions.

## 🚀 What's next for DivaSwarm AI
- **Vision-Integrated UX Audits**: Fully maturing the "Designer" agent to utilize Antigravity’s vision capabilities for real-time UI/UX critiquing.
- **Automated Skill Fabric**: Expanding the `Build-Fixer` to resolve environment-level drift across distributed CLI deployments.
- **Multi-Agent Team Pulse**: A collaborative mode where teams can sync on the same project state across different Claude CLI instances.
